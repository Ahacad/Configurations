Install all configurations on a Linux machine with [this install-configs.sh script in folder .config/SELFMADE](./.config/SELFMADE/install-configs.sh)

Refer to [using-arch](https://github.com/ahacad/using-arch)  for the awesome programs on Arch inux (another one of my repo).

### Philosophy

**Ideal effects**: sit down on a newly installed Arch Linux machine, clone this repo, install all the programs and configurations, and get started on working, efficiently.
